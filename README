Here's everything you need to know about stacks in terms of my program.

You might be wondering what a stack is. To put it simply, it is a way computers can store data. Think of it as pouring water into a cup. 
The water that first gets poured in goes to the bottom of the cup, and the water that last gets poured in goes to the top.
If you want to drink (output) from the cup, then you have to start from the top of the cup. You can't magically drink from water halfway in the cup.
That's the idea behind storing data as stacks. All data must be input to the top of the stack, and data can only be output from the top of said stack.

1) when you save the program on your device, make sure that the text file is saved IN THE SAME FOLDER or else there will be issues.
